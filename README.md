A quick script to choose how to use your external monitor in Linux and OpenBSD, written in BASH.

Install with:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/royaleconqueso/monitor/main/mtr.sh && chmod 755 mtr.sh
```

Put it somewhere in your path, and run with:

```
./mtr.sh
```
The first time you run it is recommended that you choose the x option to check that xrandr finds three connected monitors
